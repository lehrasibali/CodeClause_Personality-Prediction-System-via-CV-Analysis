# CodeClause_Personality-Prediction-System-via-CV-Analysis
This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to predict personality traits using a dataset containing information about individuals' gender, age, and scores on the "Big Five" personality traits: openness, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion. 
Data

The dataset consists of two CSV files: "train_data.csv" and "test_data.csv". The training data contains labeled samples, including the personality trait class labels, while the test data contains unlabeled samples for evaluation.

Machine Learning Models

The project explores several machine learning algorithms for personality prediction, including:

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classification algorithm that separates data points into different classes using hyperplanes.
Neural Networks: A deep learning approach using a feedforward neural network to capture complex patterns in the data.
Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

The project evaluates each model's performance using accuracy and classification reports, providing insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for each personality class. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning techniques are applied to optimize the models' performance.

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

In this project, we also demonstrate the application of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for personality prediction. KNN is a simple yet effective classification method that predicts the class label of a data point based on its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.
